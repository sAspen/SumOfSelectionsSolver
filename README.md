# SumOfSelectionsSolver
Created for a course assignement in the fall of 2012. 

From the relevant course's page: 

"The problem "Sum of Selections" (SOS) is defined as follows: Given a sequence of n positive integers t_1, t_2, ... , t_n, and a  positive integer K we  are  asked to make  a selection of the t_iâ€™s with sum exactly K (or determine that no such selection exists)."
